# Figma MCP Use Case: Login UI Concept Implementation

This project demonstrates how to convert a Figma design into frontend code using the [Figma‑Context‑MCP](https://github.com/GLips/Figma-Context-MCP). The output is implemented in HTML and styled with Tailwind CSS, but the same process can be adapted to generate code for other platforms such as iOS or Android.
